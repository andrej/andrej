Hi! I'm Andr√©, a Ph.D. student in the [Secure Systems and Software Lab](https://ssllab.org) at the University of California, Irvine. 
My research interests lie broadly in operating systems, security and compilers.
I am currently working on a novel multi-variant execution environment that incorporates attacker deception techniques.
